# GhostSite

A custom theme for [Ghost](http://github.com/tryghost/ghost/).

This theme is a copy of [casper](https://github.com/TryGhost/Casper), but made to be more of a website theme than a blog.

Changes from Casper:
- Optional Image slider
- `Home` post will be used as static text on Home page.
- `News & Updates` section on the right side of Home.
- Header uses site name or logo and horizontal menu.
